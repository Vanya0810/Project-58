      <p>The first reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. Swimming offers many different strokes, so it doesn't feel like you're stuck doing the same thing over and over again.In the summer, swimming provides a nice, refreshing break! There’s nothing better than jumping into the water on a hot, sweltering summer’s day. The pool makes you feel instantly better. And I think it adds to the summer holiday feeling, as for me the summer months are when I swim the most. It is a sport which can be done all over the world in many beautiful locations. You can choose to swim in a swimming pool or to go splash in the sea.
